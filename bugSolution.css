The problem lies in how Tailwind processes `@layer` directives within components.  The solution often involves moving the `@apply` directive outside the `@layer` or restructuring the CSS to avoid this conflict.  Here's a revised approach:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */

.my-component {
  @apply bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded;
}

/*Alternatively, if you still need layers, apply the styles directly instead of using @apply*/

@layer components {
  .my-component {
    background-color: #f5f5f5; /* Directly apply styles here*/
    padding: 1rem;
    border-radius: 0.25rem; 
  }
}
```

By applying the styles directly to the component class or by reorganizing your layers and removing reliance on `@apply` within the problematic layer, the intended styling can be achieved.
