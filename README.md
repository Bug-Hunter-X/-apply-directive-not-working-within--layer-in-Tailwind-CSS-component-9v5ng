# Tailwind CSS @apply Issue within @layer

This repository demonstrates a problem where Tailwind's `@apply` directive doesn't function as expected when used inside a `@layer` directive within a component's CSS.  The styles defined using `@apply` are not being properly applied to the component.

## Problem Description

The `@apply` directive is intended to apply pre-defined utility classes to a component, simplifying the process of applying styles. However, when this directive is used within a component-specific `@layer`, the expected style application does not occur.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (if any).
3. Run the application or build process.
4. Observe that the component does not have the styles applied as expected, indicating that the `@apply` directive within the `@layer` is not functioning correctly.

## Solution

A potential solution is discussed and shown in the `bugSolution.css` file.
